## How to Add Your Character Image

To use the character image from your design in the game:

1. **Save your image** as `player.png` in this folder (`assets/player.png`)
2. **Recommended format**: PNG with transparent background
3. **Recommended size**: 50x60 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
4. The game will automatically load and use the image if it exists

## Alternative: Use Figma Link

If you have a Figma link, I can help download the image directly using the Figma MCP tools.

## Current Status

- If `player.png` exists → Game will use the image
- If `player.png` doesn't exist → Game will draw the character using canvas

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG (with transparency preferred)
- Size: 50x60 pixels recommended (will be scaled)
- Background: Transparent preferred
- Content: Character facing right or forward
